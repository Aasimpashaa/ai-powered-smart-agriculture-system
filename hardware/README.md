# Hardware Module

This folder contains all hardware-related components of the
**AI-Powered Smart Agriculture System**.

## Hardware Components

- **Arduino Uno**
  Central microcontroller responsible for sensor data acquisition
  and automated irrigation control.

- **Soil Moisture Sensor (FC-28)**
  Measures soil moisture levels and triggers irrigation decisions.

- **Relay Module**
  Acts as an electronic switch to safely control the water pump.

- **Water Pump**
  Provides automated irrigation based on sensor thresholds.

## Folder Structure

- **arduino/**  
  Arduino source code (.ino) for irrigation logic and sensor reading.

- **sensors/**  
  Sensor specifications, calibration notes, and connection details.

- **relay_module/**  
  Relay specifications and wiring details.

- **water_pump/**  
  Pump specifications and operational notes.

- **diagrams/**  
  Hardware block diagrams, wiring diagrams, and setup images.

## Notes
- The irrigation logic follows threshold-based control as described
  in the project report.
- Hardware design prioritizes affordability and scalability.
